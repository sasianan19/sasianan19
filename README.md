## ✨About Me✨ 

🏔️ Hi! My name is Sierra and I am passionate about utilizing the world of tech to empower underserved and disenfranchised youth. In 2016, a group of 6 peers and I founded the non-profit resource Black Youth in Denver (BYD). After dismissing myself from the board in late 2017, I felt it would be best to think of ways to provide more concrete assistance to young people who were either on the brink of falling victim to the preschool-to-prison pipeline or those who had already found themselves pulled in. I know in my heart that there is an abundance of entrepreneurial-minded youngins in every cut who would surely benefit from a chance or five to put their keen intellect to use for a stable and healthier future!

⛩️ When I'm not slouched over a keyboard, you can find me engrossed in a book or speed-walking like a Korean grandma getting her steps in at the mall (my Halmoni used to take me mall-walking with her)!

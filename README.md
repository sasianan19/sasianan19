### Howdy! 🤠

## ✨About Me✨ 

🏔️ Hi! My name is Sierra and I am passionate about utilizing the world of tech to empower underserved and disenfranchised youth. In 2016, a group of 6 peers and I founded the non-profit resource Black Youth in Denver (BYD). After dismissing myself from the board in late 2017, I felt it would be best to think of ways to provide more concrete assistance to young people who were either on the brink of falling victim to the preschool-to-prison pipeline or those who had already found themselves pulled in. I know in my heart that there is an abundance of entrepreneurial-minded youngins in every cut who would surely benefit from a chance or five to put their keen intellect to use for a stable and healthier future!

🌞 When I'm not slouched over a keyboard, you can find me engrossed in a book or speed-walking like a Korean grandma getting her steps in at the mall (my Halmoni used to take me mall-walking with her)! 


## ⚡What Am I Up To?⚡

~ 🎨 I’m currently working on an accessible information hub for first-time and teen parents. This hub will include links to sliding scale fee and free classes, tips for parenting practices in relation to a child's stage in development, a breakdown of therapy options with emphasis on rape and postpartum depression, and clinics that offer safe, discreet termination services. This is merely the tip of the iceberg, so stay tuned!

~ 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to add to my HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, jQuery, and Node.js skills!

~ 🌎 Fun fact: During WWI and WWII, code talkers were courageous groups of indigenous armed service members whose sacred languages aided in the development of communications in front-line operations.
